# Visual Diagrams for Exclusion Transparency Log

This document contains ASCII art diagrams that illustrate the data structure.

## Simple Tree Example

### Values: [10, 20, 30, 40]

```
Sorted Input: [10, 20, 30, 40]

Binary Merkle Tree (leaves in sorted order):

                        Root (H_R)
                       /          \
                      /            \
                     /              \
                H(H_A || H_B)        \
                   /                  \
                  /                    \
              Node A                   Node B
            (H_A = H(H_10 || H_20))   (H_B = H(H_30 || H_40))
            /              \           /              \
           /                \         /                \
      Leaf(10)          Leaf(20)  Leaf(30)          Leaf(40)
      H_10              H_20      H_30              H_40

Where:
  H_10 = SHA256("LEAF:" || "10")
  H_20 = SHA256("LEAF:" || "20")
  H_30 = SHA256("LEAF:" || "30")
  H_40 = SHA256("LEAF:" || "40")
  H_A  = SHA256("NODE:" || H_10 || H_20)
  H_B  = SHA256("NODE:" || H_30 || H_40)
  H_R  = SHA256("NODE:" || H_A || H_B)
```

**Key Property**: Reading leaves left-to-right gives sorted order: 10 < 20 < 30 < 40

## Inclusion Proof Visualization

### Proving that 30 is in the tree:

```
Step 1: Identify the leaf
        Leaf(30) has hash H_30

Step 2: Collect sibling hashes on path to root

                        Root
                       /    \
                      /      \
                   [A]        B    ← Sibling 2: H_A (is_left=True)
                   /  \      / \
                  /    \    /   \
                10    20  30   [40] ← Sibling 1: H_40 (is_left=False)
                             ^^^
                          TARGET

Path from leaf to root:
  Leaf(30) → Node B → Root

Siblings needed:
  1. H_40 (right sibling in Node B)
  2. H_A (left sibling at Root)

Proof = {
  value: 30,
  leaf_hash: H_30,
  siblings: [(H_40, False), (H_A, True)],
  root_hash: H_R
}
```

### Verification Process:

```
Start:  current = H_30

Step 1: Sibling is H_40 (is_left=False)
        ⟹ current = H(current || H_40)
        ⟹ current = H(H_30 || H_40)
        ⟹ current = H_B ✓

Step 2: Sibling is H_A (is_left=True)
        ⟹ current = H(H_A || current)
        ⟹ current = H(H_A || H_B)
        ⟹ current = H_R ✓

Result: current == root_hash ⟹ PROOF VALID
```

## Exclusion Proof Visualization

### Proving that 25 is NOT in the tree [10, 20, 30, 40]:

```
Values in sorted order:
  [10, 20, 30, 40]

Target: 25

Find gap where 25 would need to be:
  10 < 20 < [25] < 30 < 40
           ^^^^^^
        GAP HERE!

Predecessor: 20 (largest value < 25)
Successor:   30 (smallest value > 25)
```

### Exclusion Proof Structure:

```
ExclusionProof {
  target: 25
  
  predecessor: 20
  predecessor_proof: InclusionProof for 20 {
    Shows that 20 is in the tree
  }
  
  successor: 30
  successor_proof: InclusionProof for 30 {
    Shows that 30 is in the tree
  }
  
  root_hash: H_R
}
```

### Verification Logic:

```
1. Verify predecessor_proof is valid
   ✓ 20 is in the tree
   
2. Verify successor_proof is valid
   ✓ 30 is in the tree
   
3. Check ordering: predecessor < target < successor
   ✓ 20 < 25 < 30
   
4. Check same root
   ✓ Both proofs have root_hash = H_R

Conclusion: Since the tree is sorted and we've proven that
20 and 30 are consecutive values in the tree, and 25 falls
between them, 25 CANNOT be in the tree.
```

## Edge Cases

### Case 1: Target smaller than all values

```
Tree: [10, 20, 30, 40]
Target: 5

Gap: [5] < 10 < 20 < 30 < 40
     ^^^

ExclusionProof {
  target: 5
  predecessor: None
  successor: 10
  predecessor_proof: None
  successor_proof: InclusionProof(10)
}

Verification: 
  ✓ target < successor
  ✓ No predecessor needed (5 is before all values)
```

### Case 2: Target larger than all values

```
Tree: [10, 20, 30, 40]
Target: 50

Gap: 10 < 20 < 30 < 40 < [50]
                        ^^^^

ExclusionProof {
  target: 50
  predecessor: 40
  successor: None
  predecessor_proof: InclusionProof(40)
  successor_proof: None
}

Verification:
  ✓ predecessor < target
  ✓ No successor needed (50 is after all values)
```

### Case 3: Empty tree

```
Tree: []
Target: 42

ExclusionProof {
  target: 42
  predecessor: None
  successor: None
  predecessor_proof: None
  successor_proof: None
  root_hash: empty
}

Verification:
  ✓ Trivially valid (tree is empty)
```

## Recursive Merging Example

### Merging two trees:

```
Tree 1: [10, 30, 50]           Tree 2: [20, 40, 60]

      Root1                          Root2
      /   \                          /   \
    10     A                        20     B
          / \                             / \
         30  50                          40  60

                    MERGE
                      ↓

Combined sorted values: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

                    Root_new
                   /        \
                  /          \
               Node_A        Node_B
               /    \        /    \
            Node_C  Node_D Node_E Node_F
            /   \   /   \ /   \  /   \
           10   20 30  40 50  60

The new tree preserves sorted order and all proofs
are re-computed against the new root hash.
```

## Size Comparison: Inclusion vs Exclusion Proofs

```
For a tree with N values:

Inclusion Proof Size:
  - 1 leaf hash
  - ~log₂(N) sibling hashes
  - 1 root hash
  Total: O(log N)

Exclusion Proof Size:
  - 1 target value
  - 2 values (predecessor + successor)
  - 2 inclusion proofs (each O(log N))
  - 1 root hash
  Total: O(log N)

Both scale logarithmically! 🎉
```

## Security Visualization

### Why sorting enables exclusion proofs:

```
WITHOUT sorting (traditional merkle tree):

      Root
      /  \
     A    B
    / \  / \
   20 40 10 30   ← Values in random order

To prove 25 is not in tree:
❌ IMPOSSIBLE - would need to check ALL leaves!
Need O(N) proof size to list all values.


WITH sorting (our innovation):

      Root
      /  \
     A    B
    / \  / \
   10 20 30 40   ← Values in sorted order

To prove 25 is not in tree:
✓ POSSIBLE - show the gap: 20 < [25] < 30
Only need 2 inclusion proofs = O(log N) size!
```

## Tree Balance

Our tree building strategy (pair up adjacent nodes):

```
Example with 7 values:

Level 0 (leaves):    [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]

Level 1 (pair up):   [1,2] [3,4] [5,6] [7]
                              ↑     ↑    ↑
                        paired  paired  promoted

Level 2:             [1,2,3,4] [5,6,7]

Level 3 (root):      [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]


Height = ⌈log₂(N)⌉
Proof size = O(log N)
```
