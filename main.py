ok. ordered binary tree.

when traversing the tree from the top, you need to know which fork to follow. how do we encode this?

Alternatively, you could binary-search the leaves (they are stored linearly - could use regular DB index to accelerate)

If you know a leaf's index, you can immediately know its path.

storage order:
12a34cb56e78gfd
(this order means a tree-merge operation uses sequential IO)

(length = 15) = 2^4-1

inclusion proof of "3" would be: 4,a,f
*ex*clusion proof of "3.5" would be inclusion proof of both 3 and 4


A "Forest" is a tuple of trees, ordered from tallest to shortest.
You can add a tree to the forest. If the two trees on the end of the list would be the same size, they are merged.
Repeat until no more merges are possible. (A forest is only considered valid if it is in "minimal" form, per this process - I may relax this to reduce latency, with deferred merges)

The root of the Forest is the hash of the concatenated tree roots.

An inclusion proof for a Forest is an inclusion proof for one of its constituent trees, plus the other hashes you need to compute the root hash.

An *exclusion* proof for a forest is a tuple of exclusion proofs for each tree.


The log is a sequence of Forest roots.

It would be expensive to check if a new entry was already in the tree, so we implement a "multiset" rather than a classic set - i.e. the same item can be added more than once. But inclusion proofs stop after the first found match.





space:

the complete forest, at any given time, occupies O(n) space
inclusion proofs are O(logn)
exclusion proofs are  O((logn)^2) aka O(logÂ²n)  (each tree's proof is O(logn) and there are O(logn) trees (worst case))

the forest tree-list size is O(logn)
a complete log of all forest tree-lists ever would be O(nlogn)
so if we had a billion entries, that's 1TiB of log - but only 32GB of "active" trees.
I thiiiiiink storing dead trees is also O(nlogn)
